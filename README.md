# Project name: Weather Temperature Alert for Cities

# Prerequisites:
1. Get open weather api key from https://openweathermap.org/api
2. Now paste the key in line 24, replacing the "YOUR_KEY"

# Description and Working Principle:
1. We have created a weather alert system in python using uagent
3. Before the program runs, run these commands using cmd
4. Pip install uagents
   Pip install plyer
   pip install requests
6. Now run the program.
7. Give any proper city name, don't give pet names of cities
8. Now set minimum temperature.
9. Now set your maximum temperature.
10. The city name with its current condition, like windy or foggy will be shown along with the current temperature.
11. If the current temperature exceeds the set maximum temperature, we will get an alert stating that the temperature is high with the temperature.
12.  If the current temperature exceeds the set minimum temperature, we will get an alert stating that the temperature is low with the temperature.
